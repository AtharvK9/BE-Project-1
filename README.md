# Car Damage Detection Using Computer Vision

This project aims to develop a computer vision system for detecting car damage. The system uses machine learning and image processing techniques to analyze images of vehicles and identify areas of damage.

## Features

- **Damage Detection:** Identify various types of damage on vehicles (e.g., dents, scratches, broken parts).
- **Damage Localization:** Highlight and localize the detected damage areas on the vehicle images.
- **Damage Classification:** Classify the severity of the damage (e.g., minor, moderate, severe).
- **Automated Reporting:** Generate reports detailing the detected damage and estimated repair costs.
